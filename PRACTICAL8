###Open a new file in IDLE and save it s geometry.py in the directory where you keep the files you create for this course. 
#Then copythe functions you wrote for calculating volumes and areas in the “control flow and function” 
#create into this file and save it.now open a new file an save in the same directory.

    if squareBase:
        base = geometry.squareArea(x)
        return ((1/3) * base * h)
    else:
        base = geometry.circleArea(x)
        return (h * (base / 3.0))
print (dir(geometry))

    area = side * side 
    return area

###Write a program to implement exception handling.

import sys
randomList = ['a', 0, 2]
for entry in randomList:
    try:
        print("The entry is", entry)
        r = 1/int(entry)
        break
    except:
        print("Oops!",sys.exc_info()[0],"occured.")
        print("Next entry.")
        print()
print("The output of dividing 1 by ",entry,"is",r)
